# VBA_Challenge
 Module 2 Challenge

 Analysis has been completed for all three years.
 Script run time was 65 minutes.

 VBA code is stored seperately in "VBAChallenge.vbs"
 VBA code is also included in the excel spreadsheet "Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm" under Modules.

 A tab was added to the excel spreadsheet called "RUN ANALYSIS" that contains a button to run all spreadsheet analysis.

 Each year tab with the raw data has two buttons added, one to run the analysis on that spreadsheet, and one to clear the results.

 Red / Green formatting was applied to the 'Yearly Change' results only as shown in the images under the instructions for the Module 2 Challenge - https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m2/lms/img/moderate_solution.jpg
The positive change in green and negative change in red only - a zero change was left unformatted.
(example:  row 36 of sheet 2020 had a Yearly Change result of zero)
